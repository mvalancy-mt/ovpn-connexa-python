   - Add error handling and response parsing
   - Add pagination support

3. **Networks Service**
   - Implement NetworksService with list, get, create, update, delete methods
   - Create NetworkModel for response data
   - Add unit tests for NetworksService

4. **Users Service**
   - Implement UsersService with list, get, create, update, delete methods
   - Create UserModel for response data
   - Add unit tests for UsersService

5. **Complete Core Integration Tests**
   - Implement tests for authentication
   - Implement tests for networks
   - Implement tests for users

## Phase 1C: Additional Services (Follow-up)
1. **Connectors Service**
   - Implement ConnectorsService with required methods
   - Create ConnectorModel for response data
   - Add unit and integration tests

2. **Routes Service**
   - Implement RoutesService with required methods
   - Create RouteModel for response data
   - Add unit and integration tests

3. **Profiles Service**
   - Implement ProfilesService with required methods
   - Create ProfileModel for response data
   - Add unit and integration tests

4. **User Groups Service**
   - Implement UserGroupsService with required methods
   - Ensure UserGroupModel is complete
   - Add unit and integration tests

## Phase 1D: Utility and Finalization
1. **Utility Functions**
   - Implement validation utilities
   - Implement logging configuration
   - Implement version compatibility helpers

2. **Command Line Interface**
   - Enhance the CLI in main.py
   - Add commands for basic operations
   - Add help text and examples

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update examples with actual implementation details
   - Add troubleshooting information for common issues
   - Create API reference documentation

4. **Final Testing**
   - Run all test suites
   - Fix any issues
   - Ensure 100% pass rate for all tests

## Current Status Summary

The project has successfully completed Phase 1A with a solid foundation for the Cloud Connexa Python client. The structure is in place with placeholder files and TODOs for future implementation. The development environment is set up with a comprehensive Makefile, and user onboarding is streamlined with a start.sh script and detailed documentation.

The next priority is to implement the essential services in Phase 1B, focusing on authentication, base service infrastructure, and the core services for networks and users. This will provide the minimum viable functionality for the client to interact with the Cloud Connexa API.
